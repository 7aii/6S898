### Installation

For a hands-on walkthrough of al-folio installation, check out [this cool video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6AJ9qPPoyc) by one of the community members! üé¨ üçø

#### Local setup using Docker

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running in your local machine:

- First, [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Then, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

Finally, run the following command that will pull a pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ ./bin/dockerhub_run.sh
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 300MB or so.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, you can use the same command (`bin/dockerhub_run.sh`) to render the webpage with all you changes. Also, make sure to commit your final changes.

> Note: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.

First, download the necessary modules and install them into a docker image called `al-folio:Dockerfile` (this command will build an image which is used to run your website afterwards. Note that you only need to do this step once. After you have the image, you no longer need to do this anymore):
  

```bash
$ ./bin/docker_build_image.sh  
```

Run the website!

```bash
$ ./bin/docker_run.sh
```

> To change port number, you can edit `docker_run.sh` file.

> If you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again using `docker_build_image.sh`! It will download ruby and jekyll and install all ruby packages again from scratch.

#### Local Setup (Standard)

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (*hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)*), do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
